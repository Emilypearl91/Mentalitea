      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>At MentaliTea, we believe that tea is more than just a beverage—it’s a mindset. Our mission is to inspire young adults to embrace tea as an essential part of their daily rituals, enhancing their lifestyle with moments of mindfulness, connection, and balance.</p>

      <p>We are here to cultivate a community that finds clarity in every cup, energy in every sip, and inspiration in every blend. Whether it’s a solo moment of reflection, a shared conversation with friends, or a ritual to reset and recharge, MentaliTea is about making tea an effortless and enjoyable habit.</p>

      <p>Our blends are crafted with intention—flavours that fuel creativity, aromas that spark joy, and ingredients that nourish the body and soul. We believe in sustainability, authenticity, and the power of slowing down in a fast-paced world.</p>

      <p>MentaliTea is not just about drinking tea—it’s about adopting a way of life. A life where balance meets ambition, where presence fuels productivity, and where every sip serves a purpose.</p>

      <p>So, take a breath, pour a cup, and steep yourself in the MentaliTea mindset.</p>
